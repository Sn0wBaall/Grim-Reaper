# Grim Reaper

I created this script becase I was bored in my psicology class.

Basically, it's a tool to snoop around the network and find out who's connected. I wanted something that looked cool in the terminal while I was wasting time in class. It scans for devices and checks MAC vendors so you know if that hidde.

Fuck CCH
Fuck Naucalpan
Fuck everything

```
MAC Checker:
    -m 			        Uniq MAC
	-M 			        MAC file
	-t, --threads 		Threads number
ARP scanner:
	-r, --range 		IP range
	-i, --interface 	Netowork interface
General:
	-h, --help 		Show this help panel
```
